            // OOP: Object Oriented Programming.
            // You can achieve the things achieved by OOP using functional programming as well.
            // In OOP we use real world objects to make real world templates.
            let obj = {
                a:1,
                b:"Harry"
            } // This is called object.
            // PROTOTYPE : JS objects hace a special property called Proptotype which is either null or refers other object. This helps to copy properties of one object into other without sweating out in copy paste.

            let radio ={
